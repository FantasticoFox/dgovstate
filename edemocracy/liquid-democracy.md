### Quadratic Voting

[Quadratic voting](http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/) is a system of buying votes, where each additional vote costs twice as much as the one before it. In other words, money buys votes, but with strong diminishing returns.

### Condorcet method

A **Condorcet method** \(English: [/kɒndɔːrˈseɪ/](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)\) is an [election method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_method) that elects the candidate that would win a majority of the vote in all of the head-to-head elections against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. A candidate with this property is called the Condorcet winner. Voting methods that always elect the Condorcet winner, when one exists, satisfy the [Condorcet criterion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_criterion).

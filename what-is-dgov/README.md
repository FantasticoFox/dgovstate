## Risks



## DLT

DLT enables business governance structures that are more transparent, more flat, and more participatory. \[Yochai Benkler and others have written about how technology now enables peers to produce goods without traditional hierarchical structures. See generally Yochai Benkler et al., PeerProduction: A Form of Collective Intelligence,in HANDBOOK OF COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE \(Thomas Malone & Michael Bernstein eds., 2015\) \(exploring the development of peer production literature\). Distributed entities may advance this dynamic further\]

# Distributed Governance

## What is Distributed Governance?

Distributed organisations are a new business and political structures, that have no centralised management, like Ethereum, Wikipedia, buurtzorg or Anonymous Alcoholics.

> Instead of a hierarchical structure managed by a set of humans interacting in person and controlling property via the legal system, a decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code, and enforced on the blockchain.

> This concept of coordination flags encompasses all that we mean by "governance"; in scenarios where coordination games \(or more generally, multi-equilibrium games\) do not exist, the concept of governance is meaningless.

Vitalik Buterin

Challenge is how to maintain and implement changes in such an organisation. As there's no direct decision maker to manage and allocate resources, management in such structures is done through the process of signalling, proposing and distributed decision making. 

> Governance is the process of establishing and maintaining the legitimacy of decision making process

### More Adaptive & Resilient {#more-adaptive-and-safe}

Current world can be described with the acronym VUCA: volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. So the rigid knowledge or established management practices don't help to keep up with the fast-moving world. The distribution of the governance support faster learning, experiments and while can be suboptimal at some intervals, helps to evolve in the long run. Also eliminating the single point of failure, so if the central node is taken out or corrupted, the organisation finds ways to restore the direction.

### More Efficient {#more-efficient}

This is mostly connected withe the decreased cost of financial \(and other\) intermediation. E.g. Bitcoin that helped to eliminate costs and delays in the transfers, taking out the banks out of the system. But besides financial factors current management system can be too expensive. Usually a decision needs to pass many levels of the hierarchy, meanwhile the opportunity window can be lost or the cost of that decision can exceed it's value.

Another point is that people at the place usually have more info on the situation and make a better decision, as it will also directly involve them.

### Driven by Purpose {#driven-by-purpose}

If the organisation is clear in it's goals and open to participation it can organically attract people and resources motivated by the end goal. It usually results in stakeholder communities, where people solve own problems. Motivation and stake here is much bigger than in the typical hiring places of work. Thus participation in the governance is requested, not avoided.

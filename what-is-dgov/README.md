# Distributed Governance

## What is Distributed Governance?

Distributed organisations are a new business and political structures, that have no centralised management, like Ethereum, Wikipedia, buurtzorg or Anonymous Alcoholics.

> Instead of a hierarchical structure managed by a set of humans interacting in person and controlling property via the legal system, a decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code, and enforced on the blockchain.

Vitalik Buterin

Challenge is how to maintain and implement changes in such an organisation. As there's no direct decision maker to manage and allocate resources, management in such structures is done through the process of signalling, proposing and distributed decision making.

### More Adaptive & Resilient {#more-adaptive-and-safe}

Current world can be described with the acronym VUCA: volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. So the rigid knowledge or established management practices don't help to keep up with the fast-moving world. The distribution of the governance support faster learning, experiments and while can be suboptimal at some intervals, helps to evolve in the long run. Also eliminating the single point of failure, so if the central node is taken out or corrupted, the organisation finds ways to restore the direction.

### More Efficient {#more-efficient}

This is mostly connected withe the decreased cost of financial \(and other\) intermediation. E.g. Bitcoin that helped to eliminate costs and delays in the transfers, taking out the banks out of the system. But besides financial factors current management system can be too expensive. Usually a decision needs to pass many levels of the hierarchy, meanwhile the opportunity window can be lost or the cost of that decision can exceed it's value.

Another point is that people at the place usually have more info on the situation and make a better decision, as it will also directly involve them.

### Driven by Purpose {#driven-by-purpose}

If the organisation is clear in it's goals and open to participation it can organically attract people and resources motivated by the end goal. It usually results in stakeholder communities, where people solve own problems. Motivation and stake here is much bigger than in the typical hiring places of work. Thus participation in the governance is requested, not avoided.

## Tasks and Challenges {#tasks-and-existent-issues}

### The Tyranny of Structurelessness {#the-tyranny-of-structurelessness}

Most of the networks are initialised under some leadership of a person or a small group. After a while the influence spreads, but still the group of long lasting or most connected members are informally directing important decisions. Which usually works fine, but rarely is transparent who those people are and how decisions are made. Thus newcomers or minorities  have hard times in understanding their role and opportunities to make changes, that often result in participation churn. Here's how the initial thesis was stated by Jo Freeman, regarding the power relations within radical feminist collectives in 60s.

> This apparent lack of structure too often disguised an informal, unacknowledged and unaccountable leadership that was all the more pernicious because its very existence was denied.

Jo Freeman

Thus finding the ways to discover and clarify existent structures, fetch out the existing policies and rules, especially when they don't align with the proclaimed values, is supporting the decentralization more than harming it.

### Free-Rider Problems & Incentive design {#free-rider-problems-and-incentive-design}

> In economics, the free-rider problem occurs when those who benefit from resources, public goods, or services do not pay for them, which results in an underprovision of those goods or services.

Cornes, Richard; Sandler, Todd \(1986\). The Theory of Externalities, Public Goods and Club Goods. 

The free-riders problem is not only connected with the lack of financial gains for low-stake participants. Attention, care, support and labor are usually even more important and can't be easily incentivised. This results in low motivation towards things like voting. Moving power from regular users to the engaged groups, that can have misaligned interests. An so defeating the purpose of power distribution.

### Difficulty of Setting Formalised Rules {#difficulty-of-setting-fully-formalised-rules}

It can be either the rules that lack enforcements \(employees must wash hands\). Or difficulty to legitimise without the central organ, especially against a powerful lobby. Ability to have caveats adds freedom, and taking this out may be not supported even among the value keepers. Thus the efforts to resolve the structurelessness problem may be too hard to carry.

Criticism of the rules lies in the ability to game them. Even is most users would follow them, the knowledge that bad actors can legitimately violate their purpose feels sour. And thus such rules can be kept for long in discussion. This goes even harder with the smart contracts, where there's no trusted facility to resolve disputes.

### Regulatory & Public Accountability Concerns {#regulatory-risk}

Centralisation emerged as the main motive and driver for the latest economy and society development. The benefits of the economy of scale and order are valued by the majority. Still it's potential is still not fully exhausted. So proponents of this dominating ideology go against the anti-pattern, seeing it as a way to chaos.

Building a system on the outlying principles will not only run into the misunderstanding. But also can face a real confrontation from the existing juridical system and public opinion. The challenges here is not in destroying the existing system, but in educating and integrating current state with the future vision.

### Lack of Established Practices & Cases 

As a summary, distributed governance is an evolution proposal and experiment. Forward thinking parties start to try it out with some success. Though there's not a lot of well-known and clear results that can be taken into comparison with many long-living centrlalised systems.

Only research and experiment in this sphere and only after some time can move global perspective to adopting distributed governance. Clearly this will produce mistakes and criticism, but it's a natural way to learn.

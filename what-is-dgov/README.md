# Distributed Governance

## What is Distributed Governance?

Distributed organisations are a new business and political structures, that have no centralised management, like Ethereum, Wikipedia, buurtzorg or Anonymous Alcoholics.

> Instead of a hierarchical structure managed by a set of humans interacting in person and controlling property via the legal system, a decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code, and enforced on the blockchain.

Vitalik Buterin

Challenge is how to maintain and implement changes in such an organisation. As there's no direct decision maker to manage and allocate resources, management in such structures is done through the process of signalling, proposing and distributed decision making. 

> Governance is the process of establishing and maintaining the legitimacy of decision making process

Vlad Zamfir

### Benefits & Why do we need it?

* More Adaptive / Faster learning in VUCA Environment
* More Efficient / Decreased Cost of Financial \(and other\) Intermediation
* Purpose / Community Driven \(Selectively Incorporate Stakeholder Communities\)

### Risks

* Difficulty of setting fully formalised rules, like Smart Contract Coding
* Free-Rider Problems
* Regulatory Risk
* Public Accountability Concerns

## Role of Blockchain & DLT

DLT \(distributed ledger technology\) enables business governance structures that are more transparent, more flat, and more participatory. \[Yochai Benkler and others have written about how technology now enables peers to produce goods without traditional hierarchical structures. See generally Yochai Benkler et al., PeerProduction: A Form of Collective Intelligence,in HANDBOOK OF COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE \(Thomas Malone & Michael Bernstein eds., 2015\) \(exploring the development of peer production literature\). Distributed entities may advance this dynamic further\]

### Smart Contracts

> Instead, a smart contract is, at its core, “a computer protocol—an algorithm—that can self-execute, self-enforce, self-verify, and selfconstrain the performance of” its instructions.

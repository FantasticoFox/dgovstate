# Futarchy

In [futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy), society defines its values and then prediction markets are used to decide what actions will maximize those values. Said another [way](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/): [“vote on values, bet on beliefs”](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html). It was [originally proposed](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy2000.pdf) in 2000 by [Robin Hanson](http://www.overcomingbias.com/bio), an economics professor at George Mason University.

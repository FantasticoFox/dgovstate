# Tezos

In [Tezos](https://www.tezos.com/), [anyone can submit a change to the governance structure](https://www.quora.com/How-is-Tezos-different-from-Ethereum?share=d5c26090&srid=OAAh) in the form of a code update. An on-chain vote occurs, and if passed, the update makes its way on to a test network. After a period of time on the test network, a confirmation vote occurs, at which point the change goes live on the main network. They call this concept a “self-amending ledger”.

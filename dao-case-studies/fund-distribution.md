# Fund Distribution

## The DAO

[The DAO](https://forum.daohub.org/) was a investor-directed venture capital fund, where holders of tokens \(internal currency\) decided where to put funds by voting. In May 2016, TechCrunch described The DAO as _“a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organization. … It offers complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance.”_ It was built on the Ethereum platform.

It was the biggest ICO at time, but sadly spoiled by the hack during their campaign. Hackers managed to steal $50M out of $150M invested \([full story](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/)\), afterwards Ethereum was forked \(cloned\) to the state before the hack, and money were returned. The DAO was delisted and doesn’t operate now. While money were saved, such situation goes against the concept of DAO being “code is law”. Hack was allowed by the code and in this way “legit”. So it raised a big questions the viability of DAOs.

## DASH

Dash \(Digital Cash\) is currently the 5th largest cryptocurrency. It’s managed as a DAO – anybody can suggest the change and open a budget request. It’s also structured a bit differently by using so-called “masternodes”, instead of a single website. Here’s how they explain it:

> Its makeup is thus: the block reward is divvied up in three parts. The first 45 percent goes to Dash’s miners. Another 45 percent goes to its Masternodes. And 10 percent is set aside to fund whatever other jobs or expenditures the Dash network deems necessary.

> With this 10 percent, Dash is able to hire — without grants, corporate sponsorships, or deep-pocketed foundations — its own developers, marketers, researchers, administrators, auditors, and anyone else the network might deem worthy to hire at any point in the future. Allocatable funds have been used not only to hire developers and designers, but also to purchase the domain Dash.org; to purchase a prototype of a vending machine that’s been used at conferences to showcase how Dash’s instant confirmations work; to purchase development hardware; to sponsor conferences; even to cover the attendance costs of people the network sends to conferences to give speeches.

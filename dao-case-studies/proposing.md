## BIP, EIP

Bitcoinâ€™s governance may not be the most rigorous but can be thought of as being governed loosely by a meritocratic process of peer reviews and rough consensus among its most active contributors. 

Governance is achieved mostly off-chain through mailing lists, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals \([BIPS](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals)\), and Bitcoin github [pull requests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls). Users circulate an initial idea on a mailing list within a dedicated community and, if met positively, a formal improvement proposal is created. Further discussion follows usually with the creator championing the idea. The final stage is usually an improvement to the code and then a pull request made to have the new feature incorporated.

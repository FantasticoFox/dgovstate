## What is Decentralization

> What does “centralized” mean? Censorship, tampering, poor incentives, inequality, whatever you take issue with, we can blame on centralization. So if centralized is all the bad things anybody can think of, and decentralized is antonymically defined by centralized, then voila: decentralized is the solution to all the bad things.

# DASH

Dash \(Digital Cash\) is currently the 5th largest cryptocurrency. It’s managed as a DAO – anybody can suggest the change and open a budget request. It’s also structured a bit differently by using so-called “masternodes”, instead of a single website. Here’s how they explain it:

> Its makeup is thus: the block reward is divvied up in three parts. The first 45 percent goes to Dash’s miners. Another 45 percent goes to its Masternodes. And 10 percent is set aside to fund whatever other jobs or expenditures the Dash network deems necessary.

> With this 10 percent, Dash is able to hire — without grants, corporate sponsorships, or deep-pocketed foundations — its own developers, marketers, researchers, administrators, auditors, and anyone else the network might deem worthy to hire at any point in the future. Allocatable funds have been used not only to hire developers and designers, but also to purchase the domain Dash.org; to purchase a prototype of a vending machine that’s been used at conferences to showcase how Dash’s instant confirmations work; to purchase development hardware; to sponsor conferences; even to cover the attendance costs of people the network sends to conferences to give speeches.

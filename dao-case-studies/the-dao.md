# The DAO

[The DAO](https://forum.daohub.org/) was a investor-directed venture capital fund, where holders of tokens \(internal currency\) decided where to put funds by voting. In May 2016, TechCrunch described The DAO as _“a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organization. … It offers complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance.”_ It was built on the Ethereum platform.

It was the biggest ICO at time, but sadly spoiled by the hack during their campaign. Hackers managed to steal $50M out of $150M invested \([full story](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/)\), afterwards Ethereum was forked \(cloned\) to the state before the hack, and money were returned. The DAO was delisted and doesn’t operate now. While money were saved, such situation goes against the concept of DAO being “code is law”. Hack was allowed by the code and in this way “legit”. So it raised a big questions the viability of DAOs.

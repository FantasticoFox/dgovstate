# Acceptance

On-chain governance in Bitcoin was most famously experimented with when deciding for the adoption of a new technology called Segregated Witness or SegWit. Here miners had to vote by placing a binary flag where ‘1’ represented for and ‘0’ against. The governance acceptance criteria was specified at the start for transparency. It was a mess that eventually ended up in an off-chain old school agreement known as the [New York Agreement](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/dcgs-scaling-proposal-and-what-it-needs-succeed/) in order for the on-chain agreement to pass.

## Bitcoin Forking

> Many see how decentralised a project is at its genesis block as a bellwether as to how vulnerable it may or may not be to future forking, however there have been no efforts we are aware of to quantify this. This also makes the assumption that forking is always a destructive and negative thing rather than something just inherent to open source protocols.

On-chain governance in Bitcoin was most famously experimented with when deciding for the adoption of a new technology called Segregated Witness or SegWit. Here miners had to vote by placing a binary flag where ‘1’ represented for and ‘0’ against. The governance acceptance criteria was specified at the start for transparency. It was a mess that eventually ended up in an off-chain old school agreement known as the [New York Agreement](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/dcgs-scaling-proposal-and-what-it-needs-succeed/) in order for the on-chain agreement to pass.

# On-chain / Off-chain governance

## On-chain governance

On-chain governance is a double edged sword. On the upside it helps make sure a process is consistently followed which can increase coordination and fairness. It also allows for quicker decision making. On the downside it’s risky because the metasystem becomes harder to change once instituted. Like anything put directly into code, it can be exploited or [gamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic) more quickly and easily if flawed. ****Vlad Zamfir, a principal architect of Ethereum’s proof of stake, [feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RtSod8EXn4&feature=youtu.be&t=2h33m39s) “the risks far outweigh the rewards” and “represent an extremely risky proposition”.

One of the more interesting recent trends in blockchain governance is the resurgence of on-chain coin-holder voting as a multi-purpose decision mechanism. Votes by coin holders are sometimes used in order to decide who operates the super-nodes that run a network \(eg. DPOS in EOS, NEO, Lisk and other systems\), sometimes to vote on protocol paramters \(eg. the Ethereum gas limit\) and sometimes to vote on and directly implement protocol upgrades wholesale \(eg. [Tezos](http://tezos.com/)\). In all of these cases, the votes are automatic - the protocol itself contains all of the logic needed to change the validator set or to update its own rules, and does this automatically in response to the result of votes.

Explicit on-chain governance is typically touted as having several major advantages. First, unlike the highly conservative philosophy espoused by Bitcoin, it can evolve rapidly and accept needed technical improvements. Second, by creating an _explicit_ decentralized framework, it avoids the perceived pitfalls of _informal_ governance, which is viewed to either be too unstable and prone to chain splits, or prone to becoming too de-facto centralized - the latter being the same argument made in the famous 1972 essay “[Tyranny of Structurelessness](http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)”.

In blockchain governance, it seems like this is the only way forward as well. The approach for blockchain governance that I advocate is “multifactorial consensus”, where different coordination flags and different mechanisms and groups are polled, and the ultimate decision depends on the collective result of all of these mechanisms together. These coordination flags may include:

* The roadmap \(ie. the set of ideas broadcasted earlier on in the project’s history about the direction the project would be going\)
* Consensus among the dominant core development teams
* Coin holder votes
* User votes, through some kind of sybil-resistant polling system
* Established norms \(eg. non-interference with applications, the 21 million coin limit\)

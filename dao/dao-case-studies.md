# DAO Case Studies

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first successful attempt to create a standalone blockchain. Let’s examine it as a base:

**1. Incentives**

* Developers: increase value of existing token holdings, social recognition, maintain power for control over future direction.
* Miners: increase value of existing token holdings, expected future block rewards, and expected future transactions fees.
* Users: increase value of existing token holdings, increase functional utility \(e.g. store of value, uncensorable transactions, file storage\).

**2. Mechanisms for coordination**

Mostly off-chain. Developers coordinate through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals \([BIPs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals)\) process and a [mailing list](https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev-moderation/). Miners can coordinate on-chain in the sense that they are creating the chain itself.

## Most known DAO, “The DAO”

[The DAO](https://forum.daohub.org/) was a investor-directed venture capital fund, where holders of tokens \(internal currency\) decided where to put funds by voting. In May 2016, TechCrunch described The DAO as _“a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organization. … It offers complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance.”_ It was built on the Ethereum platform.

It was the biggest ICO at time, but sadly spoiled by the hack during their campaign. Hackers managed to steal $50M out of $150M invested \([full story](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/)\), afterwards Ethereum was forked \(cloned\) to the state before the hack, and money were returned. The DAO was delisted and doesn’t operate now. While money were saved, such situation goes against the concept of DAO being “code is law”. Hack was allowed by the code and in this way “legit”. So it raised a big questions the viability of DAOs.

## Dash

Dash \(Digital Cash\) is currently the 5th largest cryptocurrency. It’s managed as a DAO – anybody can suggest the change and open a budget request. It’s also structured a bit differently by using so-called “masternodes”, instead of a single website. Here’s how they explain it:

> Its makeup is thus: the block reward is divvied up in three parts. The first 45 percent goes to Dash’s miners. Another 45 percent goes to its Masternodes. And 10 percent is set aside to fund whatever other jobs or expenditures the Dash network deems necessary.

> With this 10 percent, Dash is able to hire — without grants, corporate sponsorships, or deep-pocketed foundations — its own developers, marketers, researchers, administrators, auditors, and anyone else the network might deem worthy to hire at any point in the future. Allocatable funds have been used not only to hire developers and designers, but also to purchase the domain Dash.org; to purchase a prototype of a vending machine that’s been used at conferences to showcase how Dash’s instant confirmations work; to purchase development hardware; to sponsor conferences; even to cover the attendance costs of people the network sends to conferences to give speeches.

## Tezos

In [Tezos](https://www.tezos.com/), [anyone can submit a change to the governance structure](https://www.quora.com/How-is-Tezos-different-from-Ethereum?share=d5c26090&srid=OAAh) in the form of a code update. An on-chain vote occurs, and if passed, the update makes its way on to a test network. After a period of time on the test network, a confirmation vote occurs, at which point the change goes live on the main network. They call this concept a “self-amending ledger”.

## DFINITY

One step further would be a system which allows on-chain votes to the rules of the system like Tezos and direct, retroactive changes to the ledger itself. In other words, if something happens that tokenholders do not like \(ex: a hack, a marketplace selling drugs\), they can roll back or edit the ledger in addition to the rules of governance themselves. DFINITY, an in-development blockchain, is taking this approach. Proponents of this system point to events like hard fork caused by The DAO hack and the recent $150m Parity multi-sig bug and suggest such events would be much smoother if everyone could just vote to undo them. On the flip side, this system allows direct censorship and peoples’ tokens to be forcibly taken. As we saw with Ethereum’s hard fork to revert The DAO hack, this is possible with existing blockchains, but requires higher friction through off-chain coordination and hard forking instead of on-chain coordination with no forking. \[1\]
